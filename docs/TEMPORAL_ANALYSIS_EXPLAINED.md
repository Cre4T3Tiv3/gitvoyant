# Temporal Evaluation Explained

## The Science Behind GitVoyant

Traditional static evaluation examines code at a single point in time. GitVoyant introduces **temporal evaluation** -  understanding how code evolves over time to predict future quality issues.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Temporal Complexity Evolution
Code complexity does not exist in isolation - it has momentum. Files that show steady complexity growth often continue growing, while stable files tend to remain stable.

**Key Insight**: The *rate* of complexity change is more predictive than absolute complexity.

### 2. Quality Decay Signatures
Certain patterns in code evolution correlate strongly with future maintenance problems:

- **Rapid complexity spikes** during deadlines
- **Consistent upward tenors** without refactoring
- **High-frequency modifications** in complex areas
- **Multiple contributor patterns** in the same timeframe

### 3. Predictive Modeling
GitVoyant uses temporal pattern evaluation to identify files at risk (i.e., exposure):

```
Quality Decay Risk = f(
    complexity_tenor,
    change_frequency,
    author_diversity,
    modification_patterns
)
```

## The Algorithm

### Phase 1: Temporal Data Extraction
1. **Git History Evaluation**: Extract commit history for target files
2. **Metric Evolution**: Calculate complexity metrics at each commit
3. **Pattern Detection**: Identify tenors, spikes, and anomalies

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment
1. **Tenor Evaluation**: Linear regression on complexity evolution
2. **Volatility Measurement**: Standard deviation of complexity changes
3. **Risk Correlation**: Map patterns to known quality decay indicators

### Phase 3: Pattern Evaluation
1. **Pattern Classification**: Identify improvement vs decay signatures
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood of quality issues based on tenors
3. **Tenor Projection**: Extrapolate current complexity evolution patterns

## Why This Works

### Traditional Approach (Snapshot)
```
Code Review â†’ Find Current Issues â†’ Fix Current Issues
```
**Problem**: Reactive, misses evolving patterns

### GitVoyant Approach (Temporal)
```
Historical Evaluation â†’ Predict Future Issues â†’ Prevent Future Issues
```
**Advantage**: Proactive, prevents problems before they occur

## Real-World Validation

GitVoyant has been tested against popular repositories:

âœ… "flask: Identified quality engineering patterns showing -26% complexity reduction"
âœ… "Validated approach shows promise for predictive evaluation across repositories"
âœ… "Initial testing suggests correlation between temporal patterns and maintenance needs"

## Limitations

- **Alpha Stage**: This is early research with ongoing validation
- **Minimum History**: Requires at least 5 commits for meaningful evaluation
- **Language Specific**: Currently optimized for Python (expanding to other languages)
- **Repository Size**: Best results on active repositories with regular commits

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-file Evaluation**: Understanding how file interactions affect decay
- **Developer Expertise Correlation**: How team changes impact code evolution
- **Predictive Refactoring**: Suggesting optimal timing for code improvements
