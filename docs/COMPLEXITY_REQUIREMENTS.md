# Complexity Requirements

## Overview

GitVoyant tracks multiple complexity metrics over time to build a comprehensive picture of code evolution.

## Primary Metrics

### 1. Cyclomatic Complexity
**Definition**: Number of linearly independent paths through code

**Calculation**:
```
Complexity = 1 + number_of_decision_points
```

**Decision Points**:
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- `while`, `for` loops
- `try`, `except` blocks
- Boolean operators (`and`, `or`)
- Ternary operators

**Interpretation**:
- **1-10**: Simple, easy to test
- **11-20**: Moderate complexity
- **21-50**: High complexity, consider refactoring
- **50+**: Very high risk, immediate attention needed

### 2. Lines of Code (LOC)
**Definition**: Total number of non-empty lines

**Significance**: 
- Correlates with maintenance effort
- Growth rate indicates development velocity
- Sudden spikes suggest rushed development

### 3. Function Count
**Definition**: Number of function definitions

**Usage**:
- Tracks code organization patterns
- Helps identify monolithic growth
- Correlates with modularity

### 4. Class Count
**Definition**: Number of class definitions

**Purpose**:
- Measures architectural complexity
- Tracks object-oriented design evolution
- Identifies abstraction patterns

## Temporal Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Complexity Trend Slope
**Definition**: Rate of complexity change per time unit

**Calculation**:
```python
slope = linear_regression(time_points, complexity_values)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Positive slope**: Increasing complexity (risk exposure)
- **Negative slope**: Decreasing complexity (refactoring)
- **Zero slope**: Stable complexity (ideal)

### 2. Volatility Score
**Definition**: Standard deviation of complexity changes

**Purpose**:
- Measures consistency of development
- High volatility indicates unstable development
- Low volatility suggests controlled evolution

### 3. Growth Rate
**Definition**: Percentage change in complexity over time

**Formula**:
```
growth_rate = (current_complexity - initial_complexity) / initial_complexity
```

## Quality Decay Indicators

### 1. Complexity Acceleration
**Definition**: Rate of change in complexity growth

**Significance**: 
- Detects when complexity growth is accelerating
- Early warning of decay patterns
- Predicts maintenance crisis points

### 2. Author Diversity Impact
**Definition**: How complexity correlates with number of contributors

**Evaluation**:
- More authors often correlates with complexity growth
- Measures coordination overhead
- Identifies files needing better documentation

### 3. Modification Frequency
**Definition**: Number of commits per time period

**Correlation**:
- High frequency + complexity growth = high risk exposure
- High frequency + stable complexity = healthy iteration
- Low frequency + complexity growth = technical debt accumulation

## Risk Exposure Assessment Formula

GitVoyant combines metrics into a unified risk exposure score:

```python
risk_exposure_score = (
    0.4 * normalized_complexity_trend +
    0.3 * normalized_volatility +
    0.2 * normalized_growth_rate +
    0.1 * modification_frequency_factor
)
```

### Risk Categories

- **0.0 - 0.3**: Low Risk Exposure(Green)
- **0.3 - 0.7**: Medium Risk Exposure (Yellow)  
- **0.7 - 1.0**: High Risk Exposure (Red)

## Validation

Metrics are being validated against open source projects (alpha research)
- Known refactoring events in open source projects
- Bug introduction patterns
- Developer reported maintenance pain points
- Code review feedback correlations

## Implementation Notes

### Handling Edge Cases
- **New files**: Minimum 5 commits required
- **Refactoring events**: Detected and handled separately
- **Syntax errors**: Graceful degradation to line-based metrics
- **Binary files**: Automatically excluded

### Performance Considerations
- **Incremental evaluation**: Only analyze new commits
- **Caching**: Store computed metrics to avoid recomputation
- **Sampling**: For very large repositories, sample commit history

## Future Metrics

Planned additions:
- **Semantic complexity**: Understanding code meaning, not just structure
- **Test coverage correlation**: How testing affects complexity evolution
- **Documentation density**: Comments and docstring evaluation
- **API surface complexity**: Public interface evolution tracking
