## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that promotes a welcoming, inclusive environment for all contributors. By participating, you agree to uphold these standards and help create a positive community focused on advancing temporal code intelligence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (Required)
- **[UV package manager](https://astral.sh/uv/)** (Recommended for fast dependency management)
- **Git**
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** (For full AI agent features)
- Basic understanding of Git history analysis and code complexity metrics

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cre4T3Tiv3/gitvoyant.git
cd gitvoyant

# Bootstrap complete development environment
make bootstrap
```

This will create a `.venv`, install all dependencies, and set up the CLI (`gitvoyant`) in editable mode.

## Development Setup

### Using UV (Recommended)

```bash
# Install UV if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Complete setup with virtual environment
make bootstrap

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Or add to PATH
export PATH="$(pwd)/.venv/bin:$PATH"
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for AI agent features
```
