Complexity Trend Value Object for Temporal Quality Analysis

Defines the ComplexityTrend value object for tracking complexity changes over time.
This immutable object encapsulates the monthly slope of cyclomatic complexity
trends and provides semantic interpretation of whether a file's quality is
improving, declining, or stable based on mathematical trend analysis.

The ComplexityTrend value object is central to GitVoyant's temporal intelligence,
encoding business rules for quality assessment and providing a domain-specific
abstraction over raw statistical measurements. It transforms numerical slope
values into meaningful quality indicators that development teams can act upon.

Key Features:
    - Immutable value object ensuring data integrity
    - Business logic for quality trend interpretation
    - Human-readable descriptions for reporting
    - Threshold-based classification for decision making
    - Mathematical foundation with domain semantics

    """Represents the temporal trend of complexity change in a source file.

    This value object encapsulates the mathematical slope of complexity evolution
    over time and provides domain-specific interpretation through properties that
    encode business rules for quality assessment. The object is immutable to
    ensure data integrity and consistent behavior across the domain model.

    The ComplexityTrend serves as a bridge between raw statistical analysis and
    business intelligence, transforming numerical slope measurements into
    actionable quality insights that development teams can understand and respond
    to effectively.

    Attributes:
        slope (float): The monthly rate of complexity change measured in
            complexity units per month. Negative values indicate complexity
            reduction (quality improvement), while positive values indicate
            complexity increase (quality degradation). The magnitude represents
            the speed of change.

    Design Principles:
        - Immutability: Frozen dataclass prevents accidental modification
        - Domain Semantics: Properties provide business-meaningful interpretations
        - Value Object: Identity based on value, not reference
        - Encapsulation: Business logic contained within the object

        Provides direct access to the underlying mathematical slope value

            float: The raw slope of complexity change over time, measured in
                complexity units per month. Negative values indicate decreasing
                complexity, positive values indicate increasing complexity.

        Returns:

                (< -0.1), indicating meaningful quality improvement through

        Business Logic:
            The threshold of -0.1 complexity units per month represents the
            minimum rate of change considered statistically and practically
            significant for quality improvement classification. This threshold
            filters out noise in complexity measurements while identifying

            This threshold helps identify files that may require refactoring
